# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to retrieve raw csv files, load them into Pgadmin 4 and go through the process of cleaning, transforming and analyzing. 

## Process
- step 1 : Frist thing first is to load all the CSV files into pgAdmin 4. Upon completion, I went through all the tables and columns and tried to understand the given data. 
- step 2 : After understanding the data, I started the cleaning process. I realize there are a lot of duplicates values, null values, data not formated appropriately...etc
- step 3: Began answering assignment questions and started asking questions about the data as well. 


## Results
- I was able to answer all the questions and manage to ask other questions abou this ecommerce data. 

## Challenges 
- When I loaded CSV files, I had trouble defining data types. I had to several testing sessions to finally get the right types. 
- I believe cleaning the data is the most challengin aspect in this project. This process took an incredible amount of time comparing to other procedures. 
- One of the challenges for me when I tried to clean up the table is deleting data. The reason is I was not sure if the values, columns, data that I removed were completely irrelvant and my actions might affect the results. 
## Future Goals
- If I had more time with this project, I would definitely dedicate even more time to try to understand the data. For example, there are a lot data, columns, values..etc that I do not understand. For example, the relationships between columns and tables. I would do more researching or even ask the domain experts if I had to.
